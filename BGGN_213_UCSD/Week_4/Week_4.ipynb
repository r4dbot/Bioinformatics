    "One of the biggest attractions of the R programming language is the ability to have complete programmatic control over the plotting of complex graphs and figures. R offers a ridiculously large set of tools and packages for data visualization. The core R language already provides a rich set of plotting functions and plot types. These plotting functions require users to specify how to plot each element on the canvas step by step. These “base R plots” offer complete control over virtually every pixel. However, they can be fiddly and time consuming to get just the way you want. By contrast, the ggplot2 package allows the specification of all plots through set of common plotting layers that minimally includes:\n",
