    "R is powerful data programming language that you can use to explore and understand data in an open-ended, highly interactive, iterative way. Learning R will give you the freedom to experiment and problem solve during data analysis — exactly what we need as bioinformaticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into working with real data in R, we need to learn the basics of the R language. In this section, we’ll learn how to do simple calculations in R, assign values to variables, and call functions. Then, we’ll look at R’s vectors, vector data types, and vectorization. Vectors and vectorization underpin how we approach many problems in R."
