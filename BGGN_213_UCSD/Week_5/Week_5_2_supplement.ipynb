    "### Overview\n",
    "In R programming, you use functions to incorporate sets of commands that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub program and called when needed. To begin with we can think of an R function as basically a named piece of code written to carry out a specified task or set of tasks that can be easily used again and again. \n",
    "\n",
    "In R, there are many hundreds of built-in functions like **summary()**, **dist()**, **mean()** etc. but you can also write your own functions. You just use the same language you always use in R, in the same file as the rest of your code if you like (or in a separate file that you can **source()** when needed). You can write a quick, one-line function or long elaborate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you become more proficient in R you will start to write and use your own functions all the time to make your code cleaner and less repetitive. Personally, I believe the best way to learn more about the inner workings of R functions (and hence how R itself works), is to write your own ones and learn from others by looking at the code of their functions! So lets get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will take some working code snippets and improve them by encapsulating their main activities in functions. This will mirror what you will typically do in your own work when you find yourself writing repetitive code that does essentially the same thing 3 or more times. Subsequent sections provide further details and background on writing basic functions, tips and techniques for troubleshooting and debugging your functions and finally a set of generally good practices to follow when writing your own functions."

    "Now we can see the actual dimensions of the objects and fix them accordingly. This example is really simple, but you can imagine that if you’ve written a long function that uses many arguments, you could easily lose track of them and not be sure where the issue in your function was. You can also throw in these statements along the way as sanity checks to make sure that things are proceeding as you think they should, even if there isn’t any error.\n",

    "#### Section 5: Good function writing practices\n",
    "Based on my experience, there are a few good practices that I would recommend keeping in mind when writing function.\n",
    "1. Keep your functions short. Remember you can use them to call other functions!\n",
    "    * If things start to get very long, you can probably split up your function into more manageable chunks that call other functions. This makes your code cleaner and easily testable.\n",
    "    * It also makes your code easy to update. You only have to change one function and every other function that uses that function will also be automatically updated.\n",
    "2. Put in comments on what are the inputs to the function, what the function does, and what is the output.\n",
    "3. Check for errors along the way.\n",
    "    * Try out your function with simple examples to make sure it’s working properly\n",
    "    * Use debugging and error messages, as well as sanity checks as you build your function."
